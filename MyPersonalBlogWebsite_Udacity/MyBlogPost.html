        <p>While real estate agents are still key in the home buying process, buyers are increasingly looking to do
            more
            leg work online before involving the experts. Here are our Real Estate marketing ideas for those
            looking to
            win the digital marketing game.</p>
        <h4>Set yourself up for social</h4>
        <p>Make sure you have social media accounts on all the big networks (Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Google+,
            and
            even Instagram if you snap a lot of house pics). Interact with users, share good press, and promote
            your
            properties.</p>
        <h4>Create a newsletter</h4>
        <p>Email marketing is one of the best strategies for building client relationships. Collect emails from
            your
            website, local outreach, or any other methods you can think of. Send your email subscribers the stuff
            they’re looking for – notices about upcoming open houses, new houses on the market, news about seminars
            you’re offering in the area, etc.</p>
        <h4>When might a fixed-rate mortgage make sense?</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>If you plan on owning your home for 7 years or more.</li>
            <li>If you have a monthly budget you need to stick to and prefer payment stability.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Properties for the Parent</h4>
       
        <h4>When might an ARM make sense?</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>This kind of loan is helpful for applicants who don’t have a 20% down payment saved.</li>
            <li>These loans can also help applicants who need more flexible income or credit requirements.</li>
            <li>Be aware that minimum credit scores apply so not all applicants will qualify.</li>
        </ol>
